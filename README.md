# LFSR-to-generate-a-keystream-based-on-three-different-LFSRs
This C and Python program demonstrates how to implement a basic LFSR-based keystream generator, which is a fundamental concept in cryptography and digital communications. This code can be used in cryptographic systems where a pseudorandom keystream is needed for encryption or other purposes. The LFSR technique is commonly used in stream ciphers due to its efficiency and simplicity.

The LFSR function takes three LFSR arrays (L1, L2, L3), the number of bits to generate (bits), and an array to store the generated keystream (key). Then,
* Computes new bits for each LFSR based on specific feedback taps.
* Shifts the bits in each LFSR to the right and inserts the new bit at the beginning.
* Combines the last bits of all three LFSRs to generate a keystream bit, which is stored in the key array.
